My name is 4194304, in some other places I may be known as StereoMadnessss.

I like to have fun with Minecraft mods and do interesting things with Windows.
c0.0.14a_08 is my favorite Minecraft version.
Windows Vista is my favorite Windows version for the beautiful, original, and innovative design it has.
I would especially recommend taking a look at https://cursedcreationsteam.github.io, there is a lot of effort put into those mods, so please try them.
I know CSS and HTML, it is a lot of fun to do web design with those two tools.
I am completely against ad links (except for AdFocus)

There is some info, I might update this in the future
