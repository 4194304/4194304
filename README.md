# Welcome to my profile!
Here on this page you likely won't find anything exciting, so look around at some of the repositories I have.

## Fluorine
[Fluorine](https://github.com/4194304/fluorine) is currently a hiDPI focused desktop that tries to be simple, lightweight, and user friendly.

As of 1/20/24, I have plans to rewrite it in Julia first with a friend, with Wayland support shortly after.
The project is kinda on hiatus but it'll come back one day.

## Programming
I know HTML, CSS, and I am learning Julia.

## Other things
I am currently making the xlib-gtk theme, which is a monochrome GTK theme that tries to fit in with the look of Xlib applications. The theme is part of a current project I have to make a complete, 1980's style, monochrome TWM desktop with modern applications.
