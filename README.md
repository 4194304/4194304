# Welcome to my README.md file

### Minecraft
Barely knows Java, likes to test out long and BigInteger mods

### Website Design
I am currently working on my website, which will probably end up being added onto forever. The Desktop layout is something that I am especially proud of since I know practically nothing about JS. Sometimes the fact that I need to use iFrames with it is annoying, because they occasionally break when I least expect it. Other than JS, I am pretty solid in HTML and CSS, and I can create fun websites with it. I am not a website designer, so asking me to make a website probably isn't the best idea.
