# Welcome to my profile!
Here on this page you likely won't find anything exciting, so look around at some of the repositories I have.

## Fluorine
[Fluorine](https://github.com/4194304/fluorine) is currently a hiDPI focused desktop that tries to be simple, lightweight, and user friendly.

The project is kinda on hiatus but it'll come back one day.

## Other things
I currently use KDE6 with [VistaThemePlasma](https://gitgud.io/catpswin56/VistaThemePlasma) on Linux.
